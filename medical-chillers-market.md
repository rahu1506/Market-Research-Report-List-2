<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Medical Chillers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Air-Cooled Medical Chillers</li><li>Water-Cooled Medical Chillers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Medical chillers are cooling systems used in healthcare facilities to maintain optimal temperature for medical equipment and processes. There are two main types of medical chillers: air-cooled and water-cooled. Air-cooled medical chillers utilize air to dissipate heat, making them more suitable for smaller facilities or areas with limited water supply. On the other hand, water-cooled medical chillers use water to remove heat, making them more efficient for larger healthcare facilities with ample water resources. Both types play a crucial role in maintaining temperature control for medical equipment and ensuring accurate diagnoses and treatments.</p></p>
