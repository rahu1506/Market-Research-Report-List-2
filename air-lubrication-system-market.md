<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Air Lubrication System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>AirFilms</li><li>MicroBubble</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Air Lubrication System Market includes two types: AirFilms and MicroBubble markets. AirFilms refers to the use of a thin layer of air to reduce friction between the ship's hull and the water, minimizing resistance and improving fuel efficiency. On the other hand, the MicroBubble market involves the injection of small bubbles into the water flow, creating a lubricating effect that reduces drag and increases ship speed. Both technologies aim to optimize ship performance and reduce energy consumption in maritime operations.</p></p>
