<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Choke Valve Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Straight-through Type</li><li>Angle Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The choke valve market is categorized into two types: straight-through type and angle type. </p><p>A straight-through type choke valve is designed with a linear flow path, allowing the fluid to flow in a straight line. This type of valve is often used in applications where a high flow rate with minimal pressure drop is required. </p><p>On the other hand, an angle type choke valve is designed with a 90-degree bend in the flow path. This design helps in managing flow rate and providing better control over the fluid. Angle type choke valves are commonly used in conditions where fluid flow needs to be redirected or controlled at a specific angle.</p></p>
