<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The High Pressure Steam Generator Irons Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-pressurised Type</li><li>Pressurised Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>High-pressure steam generator irons are available in two types: non-pressurized and pressurized. Non-pressurized irons heat water in the iron's reservoir, creating steam that is then released through small holes in the soleplate. They generally have a smaller water capacity and provide a lower steam output. In contrast, pressurized irons feature a separate boiler unit that heats the water to high pressures, resulting in a continuous and powerful steam flow. These irons often have a larger water capacity and are considered more efficient for tackling stubborn wrinkles.</p></p>
