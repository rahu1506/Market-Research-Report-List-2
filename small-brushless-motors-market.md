<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Small Brushless Motors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Outer Rotor Type</li><li>Inner Rotor Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Small brushless motors are classified into two types: outer rotor type and inner rotor type. The outer rotor type has the rotor located on the outer side of the motor, with the stator situated inside. This configuration allows for a larger rotor diameter, resulting in higher torque and lower speed characteristics. In contrast, the inner rotor type has the rotor positioned inside the motor, surrounded by the stator. This design offers smaller dimensions, lower inertia, higher speed capabilities, and enhanced dynamic response compared to the outer rotor type.</p></p>
