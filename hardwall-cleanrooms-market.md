<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hardwall Cleanrooms Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Pressure Cleanroom</li><li>Negative Pressure Cleanroom</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Hardwall cleanrooms are controlled environments designed to maintain a high level of cleanliness for specific industrial processes. Positive pressure cleanrooms have a higher air pressure compared to the surrounding area, preventing contamination by pushing air outwards. This ensures clean air constantly flows into the cleanroom. On the other hand, negative pressure cleanrooms have a lower air pressure compared to the surrounding area, pulling air inwards and preventing any contamination from escaping the cleanroom. Both types of cleanrooms play a crucial role in various industries that require strict control over particulate contamination.</p></p>
