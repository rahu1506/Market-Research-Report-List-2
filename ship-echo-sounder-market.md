<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ship Echo Sounder Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dual Frequency Echo Sounder</li><li>Single Frequency Echo Sounder</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Ship Echo Sounder market is divided into two types: Dual Frequency Echo Sounder and Single Frequency Echo Sounder. A Dual Frequency Echo Sounder is capable of emitting two different frequencies simultaneously, allowing for more accurate depth measurements and better penetration in different water conditions. On the other hand, a Single Frequency Echo Sounder operates on only one frequency, which offers simpler operation but may be less accurate in certain situations. Both types are crucial for surveying depths and ensuring safe navigation for ships in various water environments.</p></p>
