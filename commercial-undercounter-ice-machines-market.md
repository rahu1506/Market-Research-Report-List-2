<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Commercial Undercounter Ice Machines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Water Cooled</li><li>Air Cooled</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Commercial undercounter ice machines are used in various industries such as restaurants, hotels, and bars to produce ice. They can be classified into two types: water cooled and air cooled. Water cooled ice machines require a constant water supply to cool the condenser, making them more efficient in hot environments. On the other hand, air cooled ice machines use fans and vents to cool the condenser, eliminating the need for water supply. They are more cost-effective but may be less efficient in hot conditions. Both types serve the purpose of producing ice, but their cooling mechanisms differ.</p></p>
