<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dairy pump Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive-displacement</li><li>Centrifugal</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>In the dairy pump market, there are two main types: positive-displacement pumps and centrifugal pumps. Positive-displacement pumps work by trapping a fixed quantity of fluid and forcing it into a discharge pipe. These pumps are suited for thicker fluids such as cream and yogurt. On the other hand, centrifugal pumps rely on a rotating impeller to create a centrifugal force that moves the fluid. This type is more commonly used for milk and other liquids with lower viscosity. Both types serve different purposes based on the required fluid consistency in the dairy industry.</p></p>
