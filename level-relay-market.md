<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Level Relay Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Power-On Delay Type</li><li>Power-Off Delay Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Level Relay Market includes two types: Power-On Delay Type and Power-Off Delay Type. Power-On Delay Type relays are designed to provide a delay in switching on the power. This delay ensures that the system has stability before it starts operating. On the other hand, Power-Off Delay Type relays are used to delay power switching off. This delay allows the system to safely shut down or complete any ongoing processes before power is cut off. Both types of relays serve specific purposes in managing power flow and ensuring the safety and efficiency of the system.</p></p>
