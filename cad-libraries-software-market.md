<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The CAD Libraries Software Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Web-based</li><li>On-premise</li></ul></p>
<p><p>CAD Libraries Software refers to programs used for managing and organizing CAD (Computer-Aided Design) libraries. Web-based CAD libraries software operates through a web browser, allowing users to access and collaborate on CAD files remotely. On-premise CAD libraries software, on the other hand, is installed and hosted locally on the user's own servers, providing them with more control and security. Both types of software offer solutions for efficiently storing, retrieving, and sharing CAD files, while the difference lies in their accessibility and hosting methods.</p></p>
