<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Armoured Personnel Carrier Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wheeled Armoured Personnel Carrier</li><li>Tracked Armoured Personnel Carrier</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Armoured Personnel Carrier (APC) market consists of two main types: wheeled APCs and tracked APCs. Wheeled APCs are vehicles that use wheels for mobility, providing higher speed and maneuverability on roads and firm terrains. Tracked APCs, on the other hand, utilize tracks like those found on tanks, allowing them to navigate across challenging and off-road terrains. Both types serve the primary purpose of transporting military personnel securely and protecting them from hostile environments, but wheeled APCs excel in urban and road-based operations, while tracked APCs perform better in rough and uneven terrains.</p></p>
