<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Thread Inserts for Plastic Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Tanged Thread Inserts</li><li>Tangless Thread Inserts</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Tanged thread inserts and tangless thread inserts are two types of thread inserts commonly used in the plastic market. Tanged thread inserts have tangs or prongs that help to securely hold them in place once they are installed. On the other hand, tangless thread inserts do not have tangs and rely on the locking mechanism within the insert itself to stay in position. Both types are utilized in various plastic applications, providing thread reinforcement and enabling repeated fastening and unfastening without damaging the plastic material.</p></p>
