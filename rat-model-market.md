<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rat Model Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Knockout</li><li>Outbred</li><li>Inbred</li><li>Hybrid</li><li>Immunodeficient</li><li>Conditioned</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The rat model market consists of various types differentiated by genetic modifications, breeding strategies, or specialized features. Knockout rats have specific genes "knocked out" to mimic human diseases or study gene function. Outbred rats have diverse genetic backgrounds, resembling human population diversity. Inbred rats are genetically identical to maintain uniformity and study hereditary traits. Hybrid rats are produced by crossing different inbred strains, offering a balance between uniformity and genetic variation. Immunodeficient rats lack a functional immune system, useful in transplantation or infectious disease research. Conditioned rats are trained for behavioral experiments, facilitating the study of learning, memory, and addiction.</p></p>
