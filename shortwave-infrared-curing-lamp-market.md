<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Shortwave Infrared Curing Lamp Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Lengthwise Direction</li><li>Lateral Direction</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Shortwave Infrared Curing Lamp market consists of two types based on the direction of emission: lengthwise direction and lateral direction. Lengthwise direction lamps emit infrared radiation in a uniform manner along the length of the lamp. These lamps are suitable for curing large and elongated surfaces. On the other hand, lateral direction lamps emit infrared radiation in a lateral or sideways direction. They are ideal for curing surfaces that require focused and concentrated heat, as the emitted heat is directed towards a specific spot rather than spread uniformly.</p></p>
