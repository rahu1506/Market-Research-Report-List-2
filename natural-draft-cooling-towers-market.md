<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Natural Draft Cooling Towers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Natural Draft Cooling Towers Spray</li><li>Natural Draft Cooling Towers Splash Deck</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Natural draft cooling towers are commonly used in industries to cool water or other fluids. There are two types: spray and splash deck. Spray cooling towers use a series of nozzles to break the water into droplets, increasing the surface area and enhancing the cooling process. On the other hand, splash deck cooling towers rely on a series of platforms that allow the water to fall through, creating air-water contact and facilitating heat transfer. Both types are effective in dissipating heat and ensuring efficient cooling in various industrial applications.</p></p>
