<p><ul><li>Immunoglobulin Therapy</li><li>Plasma Exchange (Plasmapheresis)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) is a neurological disorder that affects the peripheral nervous system. Two common treatment types for GBS are immunoglobulin therapy and plasma exchange (plasmapheresis). Immunoglobulin therapy involves the infusion of antibodies obtained from healthy donors to help suppress the immune response causing GBS. Plasma exchange, on the other hand, eliminates harmful antibodies from the blood by filtering out plasma and replacing it with a substitute solution. Both treatment methods aim to reduce the severity and duration of GBS symptoms, assisting in the recovery process.</p></p>
