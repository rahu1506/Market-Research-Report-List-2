<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Single Zone Ductless Mini Split System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Heat Pump</li><li>Air Conditioner</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The single zone ductless mini split system market consists of two main types: heat pump and air conditioner. A heat pump operates by transferring heat from the air inside a room to the outside during warm weather, providing cooling. In colder weather, it reverses the process, transferring heat from the outside air to the inside, providing heating. On the other hand, air conditioners function primarily by removing heat and moisture from the air inside a room, providing cooling only. Both types are popular choices for efficient and flexible temperature control in single-zone applications.</p></p>
