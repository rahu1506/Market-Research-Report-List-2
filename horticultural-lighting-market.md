<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Horticultural Lighting Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Toplighting</li><li>Interlighting</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Horticultural lighting refers to the use of artificial light sources in indoor horticulture to promote plant growth and development. Toplighting is a type of horticultural lighting where the lights are positioned above the plants, providing illumination to the entire plant canopy. Interlighting, on the other hand, involves placing the lights within the plant canopy, allowing the light to penetrate deeper into the plant and promoting growth of lower leaves and fruiting structures. Both toplighting and interlighting have their own advantages and are used in different types of crops and cultivation practices.</p></p>
