Companies are investing in research and development to enhance the efficacy and durability of their products. This includes the use of advanced delivery systems or technologies such as microencapsulation, slow-release formulations, or polymer-based carriers.</p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic has also impacted the market, leading to increased demand for mosquito repellents as people spend more time outdoors or in areas prone to mosquito infestation. This has further accelerated the growth of the chemical mosquito repellent market.</p><p>In conclusion, the chemical mosquito repellent market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.00% during the forecast period.
