<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PH Probes & Electrodes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-Refillable</li><li>Refillable</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>PH probes and electrodes are widely used in various industries to measure the acidity or alkalinity of a solution. Non-refillable pH probes are pre-filled with an electrolyte gel and are disposed of once their lifespan is over. These probes are cost-effective, simple to use, and require minimal maintenance. Refillable pH probes, on the other hand, allow for the electrolyte solution to be replenished, extending their lifespan. Although they are more expensive and require regular maintenance, they offer greater long-term accuracy and reliability for pH measurements.</p></p>
